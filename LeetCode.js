//TWO SUM QUESTION

//Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
//You can return the answer in any order.

//Array = Is a data structure that can store fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.  Used to store a collection of data ergo Variables
//Integer = In Computer Programming its a data type used to represent real numbers that do not have fractional values
//Indices (Index) = Is a method of sorting data by creating keywords or a listing of data
//Element = a single part of a larger group

//What the question is asking us to do in english:
    //Given an array of numbers, we have a target and we need to sort the data so it returns two numbers that add up to the target.
    //We are not allowed to use the same element twice (same numbers for the solution to this problem)
    // Doesn't matter how we return the number, it can be in any order!
